= index-janet-source - Generate Index Files for Janet's Source Code
:toc:

== Aim

Make reading and navigating Janet's source code more ergonomic.

When reading Janet source code, if you've ever tried "jump" to
definition in typical editor setups for more than a few cases, you may
be able to relate.

== Background

For lookups of C identifiers from within C source code, the 2 C LSP servers
https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls[ccls]
and https://github.com/clangd/clangd[clangd]
appear to offer very good results.

However, for lookups from Janet -> Janet (e.g. `if-let`) or
Janet -> C (e.g. `length` or `def`), not surprisingly, neither of
those LSP servers help.

== How

Provide means to simply create index files (tags or TAGS) that contain
locations of "Janet-relevant" constructs for the Janet -> Janet and
Janet -> C cases.

Various editors can make use of such an index file, e.g. Vim/Neovim,
Emacs, Kakoune, VSCode, etc.

This project provides a script `idk-janet` which is tuned to create
index files via custom Universal Ctags invocations.

== Installation

=== Prerequisites

* https://git-scm.com/[git]
* https://github.com/janet-lang/janet[janet]
* https://github.com/janet-lang/jpm[jpm]
* https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags[Universal Ctags] (not `ctags` from Emacs or `Exhuberant Ctags`)

=== Steps

0. Ensure prerequisites are installed

1. Clone this repository using `git`

2. Use jpm to install the `idk-janet` script via `jpm install`

== Usage

=== Create an index file

1. Change current working directory to Janet's repository root directory.

2. Invoke `idk-janet`.

This should result in the creation of an index file named `tags`.

For Emacs users, set the `IJS_OUTPUT_FORMAT` environment variable to
`etags` before running `idk-janet`.  That should yield a `TAGS` file
that Emacs can use.

=== Jump to Definition

1. In a supported editor, open a `.janet` file from within the
   Janet source repository.

2. Put the cursor within an identifier (except Kakoune).

3. Invoke the relevant command:
   * Vim/Neovim: `g]` or https://neovim.io/doc/user/tagsrch.html#tag-matchlist[:tselect]
   * Emacs: `M-.` or https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Looking-Up-Identifiers.html[xref-find-definitions]
   * Kakoune with https://github.com/andreyorst/fzf.kak[fzf.kak]: `Ctrl-p` then `t` then filter for the identifer by typing
   * VSCode with https://github.com/jtanx/ctagsx[ctagsx]: `F12` or `Ctrl-t`

== Support Details

* Indexing of Janet identifiers
  ** Janet definitions (e.g. `repl` in `boot.janet`)
  ** CFunction definitions (e.g. `os/spawn` in `src/core/os.c`)
  ** Corelib definitions (e.g. `apply` or `mod` in `src/core/corelib.c`)
  ** Specials definitions (e.g. `def` or `break` in `src/core/specials.c`)
  ** JanetAbstractType-backed things (e.g. `core/file` in `src/core/os.c`)
* Multiple output formats
  ** Types
     *** Vim/Neovim `tags` output (universal u-ctags output)
     *** Emacs `TAGS` output (universal etags output)
  ** Defaults to `tags`
  ** Select type via environment variable IJS_OUTPUT_FORMAT
     *** u-ctags
     *** etags
* Platform support
  ** Linux
  ** macos
  ** Various BSDs
  ** Windows
